# Full-Stack Open: Deep Dive Into Modern Web Development

This repository contains my solutions for the exercises from the [University of Helsinki](https://www.helsinki.fi/)'s [Full Stack open](https://fullstackopen.com/) course. Throughout this course, you'll learn key modern web development technologies like React, Redux, Node.js, MongoDB, GraphQL, and TypeScript, with a primary focus on building single-page applications (SPAs) that interact with REST APIs built with Node.js.

## Course Content

### Part 0 – Fundamentals of Web Apps
In this part, we will familiarize ourselves with the course structure and goals. We'll also dive into the basics of web development and explore the evolution of web applications over the last few decades. Key topics include web application architecture, the HTTP protocol, developer tools, traditional web apps, AJAX, single-page applications, and JavaScript libraries.

### Part 1 – Introduction to React
This section introduces the React library, which we'll use to build dynamic client-side applications. We will also review key JavaScript concepts necessary for understanding React, laying the groundwork for more advanced topics.

### Part 2 – Communicating with the Server
Here, we’ll continue our React journey by learning how to render dynamic data – like a list of names – on the screen. We'll also cover how to handle user input via HTML forms, fetch data from a remote backend server using JavaScript, and apply basic CSS styling to our React apps.

### Part 3 – Programming a Server with Node.js and Express
This part shifts focus to the backend, where we will create a simple REST API using Node.js and the Express framework. The application’s data will be stored in a MongoDB database. By the end of this section, we’ll deploy the API to the web.

### Part 4 – Testing Express Servers and User Administration
We’ll continue working on the backend by focusing on writing unit and integration tests for server-side code. Additionally, we will learn to implement user authentication and authorization, enabling secure access to our application.

### Part 5 – Testing React Apps
Returning to the frontend, we’ll explore testing strategies for React applications. We’ll also implement token-based authentication, enabling users to securely log in and interact with our app.

### Part 6 – Advanced State Management
As applications grow in complexity, managing state inside React components becomes challenging. In this part, we’ll introduce Redux, a popular solution for centralized state management in React apps. We’ll also explore alternatives like React's Context API, the useReducer hook, and React Query for managing server-side state.

### Part 7 – React Router, Custom Hooks, and Advanced Styling
In this section, we’ll learn how to use React Router to manage multiple views in a single-page app based on the URL in the browser’s address bar. We’ll also cover custom hooks, explore advanced styling techniques for React apps, and dive into configuring the build toolchain using Webpack, an alternative to the default Vite setup used throughout the course.
